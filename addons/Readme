Put all your add-on library files in this directory
Read the important guidelines below before working with your add-on classes to work

[ Important guidelines ]

1. Make sure you will use "folder-based naming standard" of namespaces in your classes
Example:
* If a class is located at './MyObjects/Person.php', use namespace 'MyObjects'
* If a class is located at './MyObjects/Sub/Animal.php', use namespace 'MyObjects\Sub'

2. If a class is in the root add-on folder, then there is no need to use namespace in your class

3. Allowed file extensions are:
	.php
	.addon.php
	.class.php
Other than those file extensions will not be found by FileSpider
